    <h1>Analyzing the policies of the current US Adminstration.</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            As the new presidential adminstration has brought with it concerns for many areas of the nation and it's policies, I decided to dig in a bit and research what policies the adminstration have passed so far. I was especially curious if the policies against protecting the environment were really to be passed or if it wasn't going to be as bad as projected. In this project, I break down some of the most important Executive Orders passed so far in Trump's 10 months in office, then zoom in on the environemental policies and their impact. So far, Trump has passed 205 Executive Orders, compared to 220 Executive Orders in his last 4 years. He clearly is feeling the power, so let's get into it and see what he's been able to accomplish so far with this power.
        </p>
